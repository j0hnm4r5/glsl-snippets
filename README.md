# GLSL Snippets

[GLSL Snippets for VSCode](https://gist.github.com/lewislepton/8b17f56baa7f1790a70284e7520f9623), as created by [Lewis Lepton](https://lewislepton.com/) in [episode 003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHww6ZbXaCQ&list=PL4neAtv21WOmIrTrkNO3xCyrxg4LKkrF7&index=4) for his [Shader Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL4neAtv21WOmIrTrkNO3xCyrxg4LKkrF7&v=HIvNePu7UEE).

I am not affiliated with Lewis Lepton or the series; I just saw an opportunity to create an extension for these snippets, instead of manually adding them.
